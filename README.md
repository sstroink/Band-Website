Spider of the Emboided Guava - Band Website

1. index.html - Start here. This is the landing page which allows the user to enter the site
initially. This page is not acessible from any other pages in the site. It links to the home page.

2. home.html - Home page. Accessed through the landing page initially. It is intended to have rotating information
as the client sees fit. Currently it has embedded video content. It can be accessed from any other page via the nav bar
or by clicking the guava logo on the top left at any time. 

3. about.html - About page has a small paragraph about the band as well as four photos. It can be accessed through the nav bar. 

4. tour.html - Tour dates for upcoming concerts with some active links. It can be accessed through the nav bar. 

5. photos.html - Image rotator with several band photos. Made using CSS3 only, no JS!

6. contact.html - Contact form asking for name email and a message. There is form validation in the CSS as well as validation
for name length and message length in formValidate.js. It can be accessed through the nav bar. 

7. crossReference.html - this page is required for marking purposes and will be removed eventually. For consistency it remains 
accessible on the nav bar as well.
